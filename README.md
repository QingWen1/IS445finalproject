Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class: 
Each week in this course we will write a weekly data visualization report. For me, this is a great opportunity to observe how well others excel or fall short in data analysis and visualization. Let me understand which charts need to be simplified, which elements need to be left, and what should be done to make a better visual analysis.
Secondly, the professor will teach us from the very basics, which is very attentive to beginners, and will communicate with us in real time the difficulties that arise when writing code, so that all students can solve the problem together. Everyone can interact with each other in class, which makes me feel very comfortable and happy.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher:
I really like the communication in your class. It makes me more relaxed and able to integrate into the class more easily. I really like that you put the course content on YouTube so we can check it out anytime.
However, I noticed that this class is still based on python, but visualization in many data analysis seems to be based on power bi or tableau. Maybe it can be balanced in the future.
