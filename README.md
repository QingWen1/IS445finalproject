Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class: 
       In this course, we will write weekly data visualization report every week. 
       This is a good opportunity to observe other peopleâ€™s excellent or insufficient data analysis and visualization. 
       Secondly, we will communicate with us in real time the difficulties that arise when writing code. 
       Everyone can communicate with each other in class. This interactive mode is very comfortable and enjoyable.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher:
       I really like the communication during your class and hope to take more of your classes. 
       And I really like that you will put the content of the class on YouTube so that we can review it at any time
